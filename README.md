# The Companion Project For "ZenStack: The Complete Guide"

This project is the companion sample for the [ZenStack: The Complete Guide](the-complete-guide) documentation. It demonstrates how to build a full-stack multi-tenant Todo app using ZenStack.

### Requirements

- Email/password based signin/signup.
- Space for multi-tenancy management. Users can join multiple spaces, and a space can have many users.
- Users can be of "USER" or "ADMIN" role in a space. Space admins can manage space members.
- Users can manage Todo lists and items in spaces they belong to.
- Public Todo lists are accessible to all space members. Private lists are only accessible to the owner and space admins.

### Branches

- `main`: the final completed code for the project.
- `part1`: the code up to the completion of [Part I](/docs/the-complete-guide/part1/).
- `part2`: the code up to the completion of [Part II](/docs/the-complete-guide/part2/).
- `part3`: the code up to the completion of [Part III](/docs/the-complete-guide/part3/).
